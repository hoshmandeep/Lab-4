/* Lab Question  
 * 
 * In this lab, we have split the refactored the Cell class by creating a new Sensor class
 * and moving much of the functionality of recording the temperature/flux 
 * measurements into this new class. Which SOLID principles are we doing our best to abide
 * by here? Do you think this refactoring was worthwhile? Justify your answer by providing
 * some upsides and downsides.
